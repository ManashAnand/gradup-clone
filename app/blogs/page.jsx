You've come a long way and should be proud”</em>.<br/><br/>Whenever this quote is being read, no wonder it always reminds everyone of Mr. Tanmay Singh Rajput whoever knows him. Born and raised in a small town, Mr. Tanmay grew up with quite of very low resources and opportunities. Failing consistently, being unable to face the fears, Mr. Tanmay couldn’t do what he had wished for and unfortunately being at the lowest point was his thing. Getting low grades in school used to be no new for him. Being used to failure has always been his habit until he discovered his inner own self.<br/><br/>Finally, the day arrived when Mr. Tanmay decided to set a benchmark. From starting from scratch, to ending till infinity & beyond! Mr. Tanmay decided to not give up and work upon his dreams very hard until he gets inner peace & satisfaction professionally. All he wanted to become, is a self-made man, educating today’s youth to achieve their goals and creating missions to accomplish their dreams. Even in college, he was so determined and focused on himself about what he exactly want to do for building the empire he always wanted to.<br/><br/>Things were getting even more difficult when he made the biggest decision of not sitting in the campus placement interviews so he had to work extra hard. Having been supported by his family and few friends, he was also judged by few people and constantly being called & questioned as “Bhai yeh kya kar raha hai tu?” Not just this but he couldn’t even give time to his own loved ones and was accused of being “self-centred busy and egoist guy”. Yet despite going through a lot and dealing with negativity and stuff like that, he believed in himself so much that finally he built his own empire, a company called “Business Garage” which focussed on digital marketing. It worked and gained a lot of support and finally Mr. Tanmay did what he had to.<br/><br/>A lot of things in Mr. Tanmay sir’s personal as well as professional life changed after he has built an empire from scratch. Looking at them, the inspiration for even others to pursue entrepreneurship had also came to trend back then. Their internship program pushed every student to carry forward their dream opportunities & not just gave them the hope, but also made every student reach heights. Mr. Tanmay’s shift in mindset towards innovation & risk-taking never went unsuccessful because of their focussed & determined mind.<br/><br/>Being a topic of comparison between them & their own sister, used to make them feel gloomy. “Bhai apni behen se sikh kuch! Chhoti hoke 1st attempt me entrance exam crack krliya. Tu kya kar raha hai? Na acche grades la pa raha hai, aur na hi acche packages k job offers accept kar raha hai! Tu kar kya raha hai bhai?” These kinds of sentences were being used by their own good people & they used to feel awful about that. Yet, despite going through all this negativity around, they didn’t give up even at their lowest & stayed determined & focussed as they could & finally proved themselves!<br/><br/>Today, Mr. Tanmay Singh Rajput became an extraordinary entrepreneur who inspired the country by their eternal excellence & hard work consistency. The most special & worth highlighting thing about them is that, all the hard work Mr. Tanmay is doing is mostly for privileging the unprivileged. The students living in remote areas, towns, villages who cannot afford paid internships or career opportunities, Mr. Tanmay is a literal career helping buddy to them by providing high level internships for free and making their careers shine.<br/><br/>In reflecting upon the extraordinary life of Mr. Tanmay Singh Rajput, we find a story of triumph over adversity, of courage in the face of challenges, & of unwavering determination that propelled them to great heights. Through their remarkable journey, Mr. Tanmay has left an indelible mark on the world, inspiring generations to come & accomplishing their missions & visions. As we turn the final pages of their journey, we are reminded that a life well-lived is not measured solely by achievements but by the lasting impact we leave on the hearts and minds of others.<br/><br/>Mr. Tanmay Singh Rajput’s legacy will continue to shine brightly, illuminating the path for those who dare to dream and forge their destinies.<br/><br/>If we talk about the initial stage of Mr. Tanmay Singh Rajput of his entrepreneurship, Mr. Tanmay started off their professional career by first launching a startup known as “Business Garage”. And that’s when sir’s proper journey began and Business Garage dealt with digital marketing for the local shopping markets and their shopkeepers. This startup opened by sir, helped a lot of shopkeepers to gain lots and lots of customers and clients and help them get all the facilities which aren’t really provided by the government. This startup of sir, focused mainly upon providing services to those shops and markets which were built in the remote areas and not so developed places so as to fulfil all their needs and demands.<br/><br/>However, Business Garage didn’t last that longer because of some financial problems, they had to take Business Garage down for their own personal and professional good.<br/><br/>Then there was time when the students knowing Mr. Tanmay sir, contacted them asking for a lot of emergency academic help. All the young students trusted Tanmay sir blindly when it came to their education, internships and career advancement. The bond between them and the students was so strong and trustworthy that the students called sir even during late night time, and sir were always up for their help.<br/><br/>These students were the only people in sir’s life who gave them the courage and confidence to start off with their another new journey and resume their entrepreneurship career with flying colours and that’s how the journey GradUp (formerly Attitude matterZ) began and doing great at the moment !</div>
